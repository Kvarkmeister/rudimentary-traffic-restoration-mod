# Description
This is a really rudimentary mod that allows the following traffic vehicles to
spawn and roam freely around the open world:
  - Ambulance
  - Bus
  - Firetruck
  
There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that allow You to restore the vehicles and
GlobalB.LZC file replacement mods, but I figured I'll just upload this one for quick use.
Some excellent mods like underground2.net already do this, but this is meant to be stand-alone.
I don't mind getting flamed for dumbo-mods, haha.
